# Overview

I have decided to learn Godot, as it seems to be a good replacement for other engines that are proprietary.

The game I am writing here is a puzzle game, it is a 2 player peer to peer game.

# Development Environment

I used Godot and Rider (Jetbrains IDE) but it still has a solution for VS, so you can use that as well. Graphics were made with Inkscape and Krita.

The game is developed in C#.
